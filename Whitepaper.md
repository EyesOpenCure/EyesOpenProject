# Ocular EYS Replacement for RP25 and Other Acquired Retinal Injuries

## Abstract

## Introduction

Eyes Shut Homolog (EYS) is a secreted proteoglycan of the extracellular matrix that is important for the development and maintenance of retinal photoreceptors throughout much of the animal kingdom. (1) The protein derives its name from the fact that Drosophila hatched without functioning EYS fail to develop open rhabdomeres. (2) EYS has a secondary role in Drosophila of protecting mechanoreceptors from damage due to oncotic pressure. (3) In vertebrates such as humans, this protective role of EYS is conserved, in which it is localized in the retina outer segment (OS), spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia to protect from damage due to oncotic pressure and other environmental insults. (4)

In humans, loss of EYS function is the etiologic cause of both retinitis pigmentosa type 25 (RP25) and autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy (arCRD). () In these diseases, lack of EYS causes generalized and progressive photoreceptor dysfunction, affecting both rod and cone photoreceptors. ()

## Proposed Role as a Therapeutic
### Treating Retinal Dystrophy
Among causes of retinal dystrophy, EYS is unique in that it is secreted extracellularly, () which makes it an excellent candidate for protein replacement therapy. RP25 and arCRD 

### Repairing Damage Due to Retinal Injury
EYS is closely related to the heparan-sulfate extracellular matrix proteins perlecan and agrin, () which have been shown to have profound tissue regeneration properties.  Agrin has been demonstrated to regenerate the hearts of mice that had suffered from myocardial infarction over the course of a month after just a single injection of the protein. ()  Similarly, perlecan has been found to ...

Agrin and perlecan are both implicated in animal tissue development, but get downregulated with age leading to a corresponding decline in animal tissue's ability to repair itself. () Since EYS is known to be involved in the development of retinal tissue, () it may possess similar regenerative properties to perlecan and agrin.  Retinal injuries, such as those due to retinal vein occlusions and infectious uveitis, can lead to rapid and lasting damage to vision. () EYS replacement may serve as a potential treatment option for such cases by stimulating tissue regeneration and repair after damage has already occurred.

Agrin, perlecan, and EYS each contain multiple epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) domains, () indicating important roles in cell signalling. ()  In the context of the retina, this would immediately raise concerns of promoting harmful angiogenesis and neovascularization, however the protein cores of these proteoglycans have been demonstrated to possess angiostatic properties. (,)   Given that EYS is naturally designed to function in the retina, it is likely possesses similar angiostatic properties to prevent neovascularization due to its own presence.
