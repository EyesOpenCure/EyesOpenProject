# Ocular EYS Replacement for RP25 and Other Acquired Retinal Injuries

## Abstract

## Introduction

Eyes Shut Homolog (EYS) is a secreted proteoglycan of the extracellular matrix that is important for the development and maintenance of retinal photoreceptors throughout much of the animal kingdom. (1) The protein derives its name from the fact that Drosophila hatched without functioning EYS fail to develop open rhabdomeres. (2) EYS has a secondary role in Drosophila of protecting mechanoreceptors from damage due to osmotic pressure. (3) In vertebrates such as humans, this protective role of EYS is conserved, in which it is localized in the retina outer segment (OS), spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia to protect from damage due to hyperosmotic shock and other environmental insults. (4)

In humans, loss of EYS function is the etiologic cause of both retinitis pigmentosa type 25 (RP25) and autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy (arCRD). (5) In these diseases, lack of EYS causes generalized and progressive photoreceptor dysfunction, affecting both rod and cone photoreceptors. (6) RP25 and arCRD affected photoreceptors exhibit progressive mislocalization of outer segment organelles. (7) Secreted EYS selectively binds to cells decorated with prominin-1 surface receptors, such as those found in the outer segment, which it mechanically reinforces by depositing a protective cell wall. (3) 

## Proposed Role as a Therapeutic
### Treating Retinal Dystrophy
Among causes of retinal dystrophy, EYS is unique in that it is secreted extracellularly, () which makes it an excellent candidate for protein replacement therapy. By replacing EYS using intraocular injections, it may be possible to halt further progression of RP25 and arCRD by preventing additional damage from osmotic forces.  Additionally, EYS replacement may be able to relocalize outer segment organelles by restoring the shape of the outer segment, thus rescuing inoperative photoreceptors.

Both RP25 and arCRD exhibit strongly autosomal recessive inheritance patterns, () indicating mutant EYS is not directly toxic and only total loss of function is harmful.  

### Repairing Damage Due to Retinal Injury
EYS is closely related to the heparan-sulfate extracellular matrix proteins perlecan and agrin, () which have been shown to have profound tissue regeneration properties.  Agrin has been demonstrated to regenerate the hearts of mice that had suffered from myocardial infarction over the course of a month after just a single injection of the protein. ()  Similarly, perlecan has been found to ...

Agrin and perlecan are both implicated in animal tissue development, but get downregulated with age leading to a corresponding decline in animal tissue's ability to repair itself. () Since EYS is known to be involved in the development of retinal tissue, () it may possess similar regenerative properties to perlecan and agrin.  Retinal injuries, such as those due to retinal vein occlusions and infectious uveitis, can lead to rapid and lasting damage to vision. () EYS replacement may serve as a potential treatment option for such cases by stimulating tissue regeneration and repair after damage has already occurred.

Agrin, perlecan, and EYS each contain multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains, () indicating important roles in the notch signalling pathway. ()  In the context of the retina, this would immediately raise concerns of promoting harmful angiogenesis and neovascularization, however the protein cores of these proteoglycans have been demonstrated to possess special angiostatic properties. (,)   Given that EYS is naturally designed to function in the retina, it is likely possesses similar angiostatic properties to prevent neovascularization due to its presence.

## Proposed Methods
### Protein Expression and Formulation
EYS will be expressed in cell cultures, purified by affinity chromatography, placed into a delivery vehicle, and then injected into the eye through either the intravitreal or subretinal routes.  Ensuring proper glycosylation of recombinant proteoglycans is extremely important to maintain their function, () and for this reason EYS will be produced in the human-derived HEK293 cell line. () 

Although initial experiments will outsource protein production, a His-tagged EYS expression vector and CRISPR gRNA will be obtained from Genscript. () The expression vector and Cas9 enzymes will be electroporated into HEK293 cells, and stable transfection will be selected for by screening with methotrexate.  EYS will be filtered from cell lysate by affinity chromatography, before having its tag cleaved away with a protease.  The protein will then be dialyzed into the final delivery vehicle solution, filtering out the protease in the process.

At a molecular weight of ... kDA, () EYS is a large macromolecule.  Accounting for this, the delivery vehicle will mimic the vehicle formulation for large anti-VEGF biologics like bevacizumab. () Commercial bevacizumab (avastin) uses a polysorbate 20 detergent to allow for better macromolecule penetration of the retina. ()  Additionally, since heparan-sulfate proteoglycans are highly negatively charged, () EYS may be able to more readily diffuse throughout the vitrous and retina than it otherwise would. () Finally, as a large macromolecule, intraocular EYS should benefit from a longer resident time, owing to its inability to leave the eye through the choroidal route. ()

### Pharmokinetic Proof of Concept
The pharmokinetic aspects of EYS will first be investigated to determine a feasible delivery route to the retina outer segment.  Purified green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged EYS will be purchased from Genscript, () and then injected into the vitreal chamber of wild type *Danio rerio* animal models.  24 hours later the fish retinas will be cryosectioned and examined for fluorescent EYS activity under the microscope.  If the GFP-tagged EYS successfully localizes to the retina outer segment, then work will proceed to the next phase, otherwise more challenging subretinal injections will be pursued instead.
