# Ocular EYS Replacement for RP25 and Other Acquired Retinal Injuries

## Abstract
EYS is an extracellular matrix-associated growth factor that is specific the outer segment of the vertebrate retina.  EYS is crucial for outer segment morphogenesis, maintenenance, and renewal, and loss of EYS function results in RP25/ arCRD, eventually leading to blindness.  In addition to its known abilities to reinforce against osmotic shock and antagonize membrane-membrane adhesion, we propose that EYS also retains the notch-signalling growth factor properties of its paralogs, perlecan and agrin.  Further, we propose a series of experiments to demonstrate the possibility of treating EYS-mediated retinal disease using intravitreal EYS replacement in zebrafish models.  Future work may also demonstrate EYS-stimulated retinal tissue regeneration, allowing the protein to treat many forms of vision loss.

## Introduction

Eyes Shut Homolog (EYS) is a secreted proteoglycan of the extracellular matrix that is important for the development and maintenance of retinal photoreceptors throughout much of the animal kingdom. (1) The protein derives its name from the fact that Drosophila hatched without functioning EYS fail to develop open rhabdomeres. (2) EYS has a secondary role in Drosophila of protecting mechanoreceptors from damage due to osmotic pressure. (3) In vertebrates such as humans, this protective role of EYS is conserved, in which it is localized in the retina outer segment (OS), spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia to protect from damage due to hyperosmotic shock and other environmental insults. (4)

In humans, loss of EYS function is the etiologic cause of both retinitis pigmentosa type 25 (RP25) and autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy (arCRD). (5) In these diseases, lack of EYS causes generalized and progressive photoreceptor dysfunction, affecting both rod and cone photoreceptors. (6) RP25 and arCRD affected photoreceptors exhibit progressive mislocalization of outer segment organelles. (7) Secreted EYS selectively binds to cells decorated with prominin-1 surface receptors, such as those found in the outer segment, which it mechanically reinforces by depositing a protective cell wall. (3) 

## Proposed Role as a Therapeutic
As a secreted extracellular growth factor (), EYS is an excellent candidate for protein replacement therapy.  The recombinant protein will be grown in cell cultures, purified, and then administered ocularly, either by the intravitreal or subretinal routes.  

### Treating Retinitis Pigmentosa Type25
EYS is intimately involved in the formation of fresh phototransducing discs in the outer segment of the retina.  As a matrix protein, EYS has important mechanical roles, including reinforcing photoreceptors against osmotic shock (), as well as antagonizing membrane-membrane adhesion to promote fresh disc formation. () This disc renewal process is happens continuously in healthy retinas, but without it the phototransduction proteins contained in the outer segment discs will wear out and begin to emit cytotoxic byproducts if not replaced.  The EYS paralogs perlecan and agrin have known roles in promoting cell proliferation via notch signalling, and we propose that EYS has retained a similar role in promoting outer segment disc proliferation.

Both RP25 and arCRD exhibit strongly autosomal-recessive inheritence patterns, () indicating mutant EYS is not directly toxic and only total loss of function is harmful.  Through intraocular injections of functional EYS, it may be possible to halt or even reverse the progression of RP25 and arCRD by restarting the disc formation process.  By replacing worn out discs, the accumulation of cytoxic phototransduction byproducts will likely cease.  Additionally, as a growth factor, EYS may be able to perform outer segment regeneration, thus rescuing inoperative photoreceptors that have degenerated to the point of losing their outer segments.

### Treating Other Forms of Retinal Dystrophy


### Repairing Damage Due to Retinal Injury
EYS is closely related to the heparan-sulfate extracellular matrix proteins perlecan and agrin, () which have been shown to have profound tissue regeneration properties.  Agrin has been demonstrated to regenerate the hearts of mice that had suffered from myocardial infarction over the course of a month after just a single injection of the protein. ()  Similarly, perlecan has been found to ...

Agrin and perlecan are both implicated in animal tissue development, but get downregulated with age leading to a corresponding decline in animal tissue's ability to repair itself. () Since EYS is known to be involved in the development of retinal tissue, () it may possess similar regenerative properties to perlecan and agrin.  Retinal injuries, such as those due to retinal vein occlusions and infectious uveitis, can lead to rapid and lasting damage to vision. () EYS replacement may serve as a potential treatment option for such cases by stimulating tissue regeneration and repair after damage has already occurred.


Agrin, perlecan, and EYS each contain multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains, () indicating important roles in the notch signalling pathway. () EYS 

In the context of the retina, these EGF-like domains would immediately raise concerns of replaced EYS promoting harmful angiogenesis and neovascularization, however the protein cores of EYS-related proteoglycans have been demonstrated to possess special angiostatic properties. (,)   Given that EYS is naturally expressed in the retina, the protein likely possesses similar angiostatic properties to prevent it from neovascularizing retinal tissue.

## Proposed Methods
### Protein Expression and Formulation
EYS will be expressed in cell cultures, purified by affinity chromatography, placed into a delivery vehicle, and then injected into the eye through either the intravitreal or subretinal routes.  Ensuring proper glycosylation of recombinant proteoglycans is extremely important to maintain their function, () and for this reason EYS will be produced in the human-derived HEK293 cell line. ()

Although initial experiments will outsource protein production, a His-tagged EYS expression vector and CRISPR gRNA will be obtained from Genscript. () The expression vector and Cas9 enzymes will be electroporated into HEK293 cells, and stable transfection will be selected for by screening with methotrexate.  EYS will be filtered from cell lysate by affinity chromatography, before having its tag cleaved away with a protease.  The protein will then be dialysed into the final delivery vehicle solution, filtering out the protease in the process.

Isoforms 1 and 3 of EYS are extremely large with molecular weights of approximately 350 kDa. ()  The large size of isoforms 1 and 3 may present issues with getting the protein to penetrate the retina.  However, isoforms 2 and 4 of EYS contain exclusively the relevant growth factor region and have a molecular weight of only 65 kDa. ()  For this reason we will select either isoform 2 or 4 for production in our EYS replacement therapy, pending further evaluation.

Comparing EYS to other intraocular biologic agents targeting the outer retina, the molecular weights of isoforms 2 and 4 are comparable to ranibizumab (50 kDA) () and much less than bevacizumab (150 kDa) ().  For this reason, we expect that EYS will be able to sufficiently reach the outer segment of the retina, and allows also us to borrow from research into their respective delivery vehicle formulations.

Commercial bevacizumab uses a polysorbate 20 detergent to allow for better macromolecule penetration of the retina. ()  Additionally, heparan-sulfate proteoglycans like EYS are highly negatively charged, () and should be able to more readily diffuse throughout the vitreous and retina. () Finally, as a large macromolecule, intraocular EYS will benefit from a longer resident time, owing to its inability to leave the eye through the choroidal route. ()

### Pharmokinetic Proof of Concept
The pharmokinetic aspects of EYS will first be investigated to determine a feasible delivery route to the retina outer segment.  Purified FLAG-tagged EYS will be purchased from Genscript, () and then injected into the vitreal chamber of wild type *Danio rerio* (zebrafish) animal models.  24 hours later the fish retinas will be cryosectioned and fluorescently immunostained with anti-FLAG antibodies.  If microfluorescence imaging shows that the injected EYS has successfully localized to the retina outer segment, then work will proceed to the next phase, otherwise more challenging subretinal injections will be pursued instead.

### Retinal Dystrophy Model Proof of Concept

The therapeutic potential of EYS replacement will be assessed using modified *Danio rerio* models.  Fertilized zebrafish eggs will be obtained from Carolina Scientific () and then subjected to CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockout of EYS using the protocol described by ().  ___ et al have shown detectable levels of EYS-mediated retinal degeneration in *Danio rerio* models within the first month post-fertilization.  Therefore, subjects will be allowed to mature for 21 days before the experiment sequence begins.

Subjects will be separated into four groups: sham injection control, __ ug dosage, __ ug dosage, and __ ug dosage.  Retinal function will be noninvasively measured via electroretinogram (ERG) at 1, 7, 14, and 28 days following the administration of intraocular EYS.  EYS loss of function causes generalized dysfunction of both rods and cones, () so subjects will be exposed to photopic white flashes during retinal function evaluation.

The goal of this experiment is to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the rate of ERG decline in at least one of the treated groups versus the untreated control.  Additionally, the multivariate relationship between dosage level, time since dose, and recorded ERG amplitude will be explored.  This will better inform subsequent experiments about appropriate dose level and interval.

## Humanitarian and Business Cases
Retinitis pigmentosa affects 1 in 4000 people, () and is estimated to affect over 1.5 million people worldwide. () Of these cases, between 30% and 40% are autosomalrecessive (), and within this subgroup, between between 10% and 66% are due to EYS mutations and RP25, () depending on the population.  This would place the total number of RP25-affected individuals at around 100 thousand worldwide.  Depending on the progression of disease within each of these affected individuals, EYS replacement could protentially halt further vision loss or even restore some sight.
